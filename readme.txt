My game is called Pokemon Red and the map is based off of the Nintendo gameboy game.

The goal of the game is to explore the different cities and towns in the region and to battle all of the gyms in order to the champion at the Indigo Plateau before your rival, BLUE.

Locked Door: You cannot go on the Cycling Road without a bicycle.  You cannot go on Silence Bridge unless you wake up the sleeping POKEMON with a pokeflute.  You cannot surf across the water without the Fuschia City gym badge.  You cannot battle certain gyms without having first beaten other certain gyms.

Hidden Object: You have to drop (and break) the ancient box to reveal the pokeflute inside.

Incomplete Object: You have to collect all of the badges to become the POKEMON LEAGUE champion.

Limited Resource: You have to beat BLUE to becoming the POKEMON LEAGUE champion.  Every time you move locations, BLUE advances further. In total you have 20 turns to become the champion before BLUE.
